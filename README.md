# Practice Exercise Repository

Welcome to my Practice Exercise Repository! This repository contains coding exercises and projects for learning and practicing coding skills as part of a coding class.



## Introduction

I am Jesus Mikael Santiago III. I was an instructional designer for a company making training and assessment resources for the Australian Vocational Education and Technology sector. Before that, I was a Senior High Teacher.

Throughout my work experiences, I have come to realise that I need to learn about coding/programming, data science and AI technology if I want to keep up with the latest trends. So far, I have only taken up free Google courses on using Vertex AI.

I have very little coding experience. When I was in college, we only used C and MySQL. Before that, I had a little experience with HTML. As such, I know that I need to do a lot to catch up with the current technology.

My participation in this free online class for frontend coding will help me become more updated on the latest technologies and allow me to develop my skills to keep up with the changing workforce environment and technological landscape.

This repository is designed for me to practice coding skills learned in class. It includes a variety of exercises and projects that cover different programming concepts and techniques.
